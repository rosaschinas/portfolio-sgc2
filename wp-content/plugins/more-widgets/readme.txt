== Description ==
The [More Widgets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/more-widgets/) plugin adds extra widgets to use with your widgetized areas within your WordPress site. Use this plugin instead of built-in theme widgets so if you ever switch themes you can keep your widgets.

The plugin is super slim and well coded so you don't have to worry about any added "bloat" on the site. Also all widgets do include default styling so no coding is required. Of course if you want to remove the default styling this can be done easily via a child theme (see the FAQ's below).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Themes Are Supported? =

This plugin will work with any theme. The purpose of the plugin is so you can take your widgets with you no matter what theme you decide to use. It works great with our [Free WordPress Themes](https://www.wpexplorer.com/free-wordpress-themes/) but feel free to use it as you choose.

= Can I bundle this plugin with my themes? =
Yes! Please do. Why code new custom widgets for all your themes when you can recommend a singular plugin. If you are going to bundle this plugin with your themes we recommend using the [TGMPA Activation Script](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/). Do not simply dump the code into your theme because your end users won't be able to update it. And if you have suggestions for future widgets let us know in the forum so we can consider them for future updates. We welcome all suggestions.

= How to remove default CSS styles? =

If you are recommending this plugin to be used with your theme and wish to remove the default CSS you can do so by setting the "more_widgets_enqueue_styles" filter to false.
